# BreakoutDeluxe
A re-creation of the classic Atari game Breakout created using mostly JavaScript and some HTML5 and CSS. Inspiration was taken from a tutorial publically provided from the MDN Web Docs site but with my own unique additions and implementation.

A live online demonstration can be viewed at the below URL.
This demo is hosted via an Azure Static Web App and is automatically updated/deployed whenever changes are pushed to this GitHub repo.
Please forgive the silly name in the URL, Microsoft autogenerates random URL names for Azure Static Web Apps that use the basic subscription.<br/>

The purpose of the file in the .github/workflows folder is to dictate the build/deployment process for the live demo hosted via Azure Static Web Apps.
This file was autogenerated by Azure and is only needed for the online demo.
